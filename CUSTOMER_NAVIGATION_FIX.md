## 🎉 **Customer Notification Navigation Fixed!**

### **✅ What Was Fixed:**

The issue was that you were logged in as a **customer** (`isAdmin: false`), but the notification navigation was only implemented for **admin users**. 

I've now added customer navigation support!

### **🔧 Updated Navigation Logic:**

**For Customer Users:**
- 🛒 **Order notifications** → `/account/orders` (your orders page)
- 📦 **Order status updates** → `/account/orders` (your orders page)
- 📁 **File notifications** → `/files/{fileId}` (your file detail page)
- 🏠 **Default fallback** → `/account` (your account dashboard)

**For Admin Users:**
- 🛒 **Order notifications** → `/admin/orders?search={orderNumber}` (filtered admin orders)
- 📦 **Order status updates** → `/admin/orders?search={orderNumber}` (filtered admin orders)
- 📁 **File notifications** → `/admin/files/{fileId}` (admin file detail)
- 💬 **Comment notifications** → `/admin/files/{fileId}` (admin file detail)
- 🏠 **Default fallback** → `/admin` (admin dashboard)

### **🧪 Test the Fix:**

1. **Stay logged in as customer** (or login with `student@compucar.com` / `password123`)
2. **Click the notification bell** (🔔)
3. **Click on the order notification**
4. **You should now navigate to** `/account/orders`

### **📊 Expected Console Output:**

```
🔔 Notification clicked: { id: "...", type: "NEW_ORDER_RECEIVED", ... }
🔍 Getting notification link for: { type: "NEW_ORDER_RECEIVED", isAdmin: false, ... }
🛒 Customer order notification link: /account/orders
🔗 Generated link: /account/orders
🚀 Navigating to: /account/orders
```

### **🎯 Test Both User Types:**

**Customer Account:**
- Email: `student@compucar.com`
- Password: `password123`
- Should navigate to `/account/*` pages

**Admin Account:**
- Email: `admin@compucar.com`  
- Password: `password123`
- Should navigate to `/admin/*` pages

**Now try clicking the notification again - it should work for customers!** 🚀✨
