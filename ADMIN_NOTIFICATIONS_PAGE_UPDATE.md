### **📊 Expected Console Output:**

```

🔍 Getting notification link for: { type: "NEW_ORDER_RECEIVED", isAdmin: true, ... }
🛒 Order notification link: /admin/orders?search=TEST-NAV-001
🔗 Generated link: /admin/orders?search=TEST-NAV-001
🚀 Navigating to: /admin/orders?search=TEST-NAV-001
```

### **🎯 Navigation Summary:**

**From Admin Notifications Page:**
- 🛒 **Order notifications** → `/admin/orders?search={orderNumber}` (filtered)
- 📁 **File upload notifications** → `/admin/files/{fileId}` (direct to file)
- 💬 **Comment notifications** → `/admin/files/{fileId}` (direct to file)
- 📦 **Product notifications** → `/admin/products`
- 👥 **User notifications** → `/admin/users`
- ⭐ **Review notifications** → `/admin/reviews`
- 🔒 **System notifications** → `/admin`

**Both the notification bell AND the admin notifications page now have identical, comprehensive navigation functionality!** 🎯✨

Try clicking notifications on both:
- 🔔 **Notification Bell** (top-right corner)
- 📋 **Admin Notifications Page** (`/admin/notifications`)

Both should work perfectly with smooth navigation and detailed console logging! 🚀
