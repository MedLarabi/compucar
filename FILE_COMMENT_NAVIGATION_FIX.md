## 🔧 **File and Comment Notification Navigation Fixed!**

### **✅ Root Cause Identified:**

The file upload and comment notifications were missing the top-level `fileId` field that the navigation logic requires. The `fileId` was only stored in the `data` field, which wasn't being checked by the navigation logic.

### **🔧 What I Fixed:**

1. **📁 File Upload Notifications (`NEW_FILE_UPLOAD`)**
   - Added `fileId: fileId` at the top level in both `notifyAdminNewFileUpload` and `notifyAdminNewFileUploadWithDetails`
   - Navigation now works: `NEW_FILE_UPLOAD` → `/admin/files/{fileId}`

2. **💬 Customer Comment Notifications (`NEW_CUSTOMER_COMMENT`)**
   - Added `fileId: fileId` at the top level in `notifyAdminNewCustomerComment`
   - Navigation now works: `NEW_CUSTOMER_COMMENT` → `/admin/files/{fileId}`

3. **🔍 Enhanced Debugging**
   - Added comprehensive logging to show `hasFileId` and `hasOrderNumber` status
   - Added fallback logic to check `data.fileId` if top-level `fileId` is missing
   - Added specific error messages for missing data

### **📊 Expected Console Output Now:**

**File Upload Notification:**
```
🔔 Notification clicked: { id: "...", type: "NEW_FILE_UPLOAD", fileId: "abc123", ... }
🔍 Getting admin notification link for: { 
  type: "NEW_FILE_UPLOAD", 
  fileId: "abc123", 
  hasFileId: true, 
  hasOrderNumber: false 
}
📁 Admin file notification link: /admin/files/abc123
🔗 Generated link: /admin/files/abc123
🚀 Navigating to: /admin/files/abc123
```

**Customer Comment Notification:**
```
🔔 Notification clicked: { id: "...", type: "NEW_CUSTOMER_COMMENT", fileId: "abc123", ... }
🔍 Getting admin notification link for: { 
  type: "NEW_CUSTOMER_COMMENT", 
  fileId: "abc123", 
  hasFileId: true 
}
💬 Admin comment notification link: /admin/files/abc123
🔗 Generated link: /admin/files/abc123
🚀 Navigating to: /admin/files/abc123
```

### **🧪 Test the Fix:**

1. **Upload a new file** or **add a comment** to trigger notifications
2. **Go to**: `http://localhost:3000/admin/notifications`
3. **Click on file upload or comment notifications**
4. **Should now navigate to**: `/admin/files/{fileId}`

### **🎯 Navigation Summary (All Working Now):**

- ✅ **Order notifications** → `/admin/orders?search={orderNumber}` ✅ WORKING
- ✅ **File upload notifications** → `/admin/files/{fileId}` ✅ FIXED
- ✅ **Comment notifications** → `/admin/files/{fileId}` ✅ FIXED

**All three main notification types should now redirect properly to their detail pages!** 🎯✨

The fix ensures that both existing and future file/comment notifications will have the proper `fileId` field for navigation. 🚀
