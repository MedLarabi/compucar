## 🔧 **Customer Orders Fix - COD Orders Now Saved to Customer Accounts!**

### **✅ Root Cause Identified:**

COD orders were not being associated with logged-in users. The COD checkout endpoint (`/api/cod/checkout`) was missing the `userId` field, so all COD orders were created as guest orders even when customers were logged in.

### **🔧 What I Fixed:**

1. **🔐 Added Authentication Check**
   - Added `auth()` session check to COD checkout endpoint
   - Added detailed logging to show authentication status

2. **👤 Added User Association**
   - Added `userId: session?.user?.id || null` to order creation
   - COD orders are now properly linked to logged-in users
   - Guest users can still place COD orders (userId will be null)

3. **📧 Added Customer Notifications**
   - Added customer notifications for logged-in users placing COD orders
   - Skips customer notifications for guest orders (as expected)

4. **📊 Updated Admin Notifications**
   - Changed admin notification customer ID from hardcoded `'guest'` to actual user ID
   - Better tracking of which orders belong to registered users

### **🧪 How to Test the Fix:**

1. **Login as a customer**: 
   - Email: `student@compucar.com`
   - Password: `password123`

2. **Place a COD order**:
   - Add items to cart
   - Go through COD checkout process
   - Complete the order

3. **Check customer dashboard**:
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000/account/orders`
   - **Should now see the COD order** in the list

### **📊 Expected Console Output:**

```
COD checkout session: {
  hasSession: true,
  userId: "cmgdfp75a0000vios40491pc5",
  userEmail: "student@compucar.com"
}

Order created successfully: COD-000XXX

📧 Sending customer notification for COD order...
✅ COD order customer notification sent successfully
✅ COD order admin notifications sent successfully
```

### **🎯 What's Fixed:**

**Before:**
- ❌ COD orders not linked to user accounts
- ❌ Customer dashboard showed 0 orders
- ❌ No customer notifications for COD orders

**After:**
- ✅ COD orders properly linked to logged-in users
- ✅ Customer dashboard shows all orders (regular + COD)
- ✅ Customer notifications sent for COD orders
- ✅ Guest checkout still works (userId = null)

### **🔍 Database Changes:**

**Orders table now properly stores:**
```sql
-- Before (COD orders)
userId: NULL (always guest)

-- After (COD orders)  
userId: "actual-user-id" (if logged in)
userId: NULL (if guest checkout)
```

**Now try placing a COD order while logged in - it should appear in your customer dashboard!** 🎯✨
