## 🔧 **Order Detail Page Fix - COD Orders Now Accessible!**

### **✅ Root Cause Identified:**

The order detail page was showing "Order not found" because the `/api/orders/[id]` endpoint had incorrect logic for handling COD orders that belong to logged-in users. After fixing COD orders to be associated with user accounts, the API endpoint's authorization logic was outdated.

### **🔧 What I Fixed:**

1. **🔐 Updated Authorization Logic**
   - Fixed `whereClause` to properly handle user-owned COD orders
   - Simplified logic: logged-in users can access their own orders (any payment method)
   - Guest users can only access COD orders with `userId: null`

2. **📊 Unified Response Format**
   - Created consistent response format for both COD and regular orders
   - Proper price conversion (COD uses cents, regular uses decimals)
   - Added missing fields: `sku`, `image`, `variant`, `productId`

3. **🎯 Enhanced Data Structure**
   - Added `success: true` wrapper for consistent API responses
   - Proper handling of customer information for both order types
   - Included Yalidine shipping data for COD orders

### **🧪 How to Test the Fix:**

1. **Login as customer**: `student@compucar.com` / `password123`
2. **Go to orders page**: `http://localhost:3000/account/orders`
3. **Click on any order** to view details
4. **Should now see complete order information** instead of "Order not found"

### **📊 API Response Format (Fixed):**

**Before (Inconsistent):**
```json
// COD orders had different format than regular orders
// Missing success wrapper
// Incorrect authorization logic
```

**After (Unified):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "order": {
    "id": "...",
    "orderNumber": "COD-000003",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "paymentMethod": "COD",
    "total": 1600, // Properly converted from cents
    "items": [
      {
        "id": "...",
        "name": "Product Name",
        "quantity": 1,
        "price": 1600,
        "sku": "...",
        "image": "...",
        "variant": "..."
      }
    ],
    "yalidine": { /* shipping info */ }
  }
}
```

### **🎯 Fixed Authorization Logic:**

**Before:**
```javascript
// Complex OR logic that didn't handle user-owned COD orders
whereClause.OR = [
  { userId: session.user.id },
  { paymentMethod: 'COD', userId: null }
];
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Simple and correct: users access their own orders
if (session?.user?.id) {
  whereClause.userId = session.user.id;
} else {
  // Guests only access COD orders with no user
  whereClause.AND = [
    { paymentMethod: 'COD' },
    { userId: null }
  ];
}
```

### **🎯 What's Now Working:**

**Before:**
- ❌ COD order details showed "Order not found"
- ❌ Inconsistent API response formats
- ❌ Missing order item details (sku, image, variant)

**After:**
- ✅ All order details accessible for logged-in users
- ✅ Consistent API response format
- ✅ Complete order information displayed
- ✅ Proper price formatting (DZD vs $)
- ✅ Customer information properly extracted

**Now try clicking on your COD orders - they should display complete details!** 🎯✨
